This development version of the vicinity package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. Currently there are no vignettes available. There is a (deprecated) app developed with prior versions of vicinity modules available at https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/ . An example of analysis undertaken with prior versions of the vicinity package, along with a brief presentation explaining the model used in that analysis, is available at https://www.ready4-dev.com/blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/
